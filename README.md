## Mini Project 1 for IS260
### By Arnold Panuelo

This is a mini project in IS260 or Business Information Systems under [College of Micronesia](http://www.comfsm.fm), 
Business Division, CIS Program.

The goal of this mini-project is to create a small program in C++ that demonstrates demand forecasting based 
on future demand rather than past use.
